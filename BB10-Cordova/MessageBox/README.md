Cordova MessageBox Plugin For Blackberry 10
===========================================

This plugin provides a standard API for the Dialog object documented in BB HTML5 Webworks, 
in addition to an extension created for password prompts.

## How to setup the plugin and run the sample

1. Install Apache Cordova and Webworks. 
2. Clone the contents of the Webworks-Community-APIs repo into a directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to BB10-Cordova/MessageBox/sample.
4. To run the sample on your phone or simulator, type into the console:
```
cordova run
```
5. Wait for a few seconds, until ```cordova run``` returns. You now have the 
sample running on your phone/simulator!
